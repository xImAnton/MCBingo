## What is Minecraft Bingo?
Minecraft Bingo is a minigame in which each team has to find certain items. The first to find all random generated items wins.

## Installation
To run this plugin you got to have a spigot or paper minecraft server.
Build this or download a prebuilt jar and insert it into your plugins folder.
Restart your server or type /rl confirm

## Usage
On plugin load a bingo game is created and no one can move or break blocks except players in creative mode.
There are 4 Teams by default. Players can join teams using /team <team-id>. The tab completion doesn't suggest full teams.
You can adjust settings using /settings. This command can only be used by OP players.
When you want to start the game and everyone joined a team, you can click in the bottom right corner on "Start"
To see the items the players have to find, use /bingo.
